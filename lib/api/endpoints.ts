/**
 * Every backend path in one place.
 *
 * Paths are RELATIVE. That is the important design choice here, and it is a
 * correction of a pattern that looked reasonable and caused real bugs.
 *
 * The tempting version builds absolute URLs:
 *
 *     export const Endpoints = {
 *       Login: `${getApiUrl()}/auth/login/`,     // don't
 *     };
 *
 * That evaluates `getApiUrl()` when the module is first imported — which, in
 * a Docker deployment, can be before `env-config.js` has populated
 * `window.__ENV__`. The host is frozen to the build-time fallback, forever,
 * for every endpoint defined this way. The failure is silent: the app works
 * in development and points at `localhost:8000` in production.
 *
 * A real project hit exactly this and worked around it inside the HTTP
 * client, with an interceptor that parsed every outgoing absolute URL and
 * stripped the origin back off if the path looked like one of its own:
 *
 *     if (config.url && /^https?:\/\//i.test(config.url)) {
 *       const parsed = new URL(config.url);
 *       if (parsed.pathname.startsWith('/api/')) {
 *         config.url = parsed.pathname + parsed.search;   // undo the join
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * Building a URL and then taking it apart again on every request is the
 * symptom. Keeping paths relative and letting axios's `baseURL` — which the
 * client re-reads per request — supply the host removes the cause. Axios
 * ignores `baseURL` whenever the URL is absolute, so relative paths are also
 * what makes `baseURL` work at all.
 *
 * Corollary: if you need an absolute URL (an `<a href>`, a redirect target),
 * call `absoluteUrl()` at the point of use, not at module scope.
