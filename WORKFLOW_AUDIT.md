# Workflow Audit — Surface 2 v3.0 operator flows

Living record of end-to-end workflow audits. Method: recon → verify-don't-trust →
fix only genuine reachable bugs → verify in a runtime → document.

## 2026-07-07 · Batch 1–3: agent drafts, approvals, console, cockpit, journey, governance

**Scope.** The newly built operator surfaces — console, agent approvals, agent runs,
sales cockpit, RunAgentMenu, journey monitor, governance claim-cards/audit, pitch
analytics. Complaint: *"the pages exist but the flows around them are incomplete."*
That was accurate: the pages rendered, but the three hops that make them a workflow
(draft→queue, queue→thread delivery, thread-held→queue) did not exist.

**Verified in the runtime** (`pnpm dev`, mock mode) by driving each flow over HTTP as
Admin / Assessment Team / read-only users, not just by typechecking.

### Real fixes

| # | Defect | Fix | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `runAgent()` never created an approval — the "queued for approval" toast was false; the queue never showed the draft | `mocks/cockpitDb.ts` now calls new `approvalsDb.queueDraft()`; returns `approvalId` | High |
| 2 | `runAgent()` never recorded a run — `/agents/runs` was a static fixture despite claiming "every invocation" | new `agentRunsDb.recordAgentRun()`, called on every run | High |
| 3 | Approving a draft delivered nothing — `approvalsDb` and `conversationsDb` were never linked | new `conversationsDb.deliverApprovedMessage()`, called on final approval; replaces the held placeholder | High |
| 4 | A held team message (claim L3+) was stuck forever — it never entered the approval queue | console message route now calls `queueDraft()` when `held` | High |
| 5 | **Permission hole**: the console send route had no elevation gate (unlike the run/approval routes), so a read-only operator could message a client thread | `canAdminGovernance` gate added → 403 | High |
| 6 | `edit` silently **approved and delivered** the draft (fell through into the approver branch) | `edit` now saves `finalBody` and returns; approval stays pending | High |
| 7 | Two-approver (L4/L5) drafts were **permanently un-approvable** — only one elevated mock user existed, and self-second-approval is (correctly) refused | added `kang@itrix.example` (Assessment Team) | High |
| 8 | Every "View lead" link 404'd — fixtures used `lead-1`, real mock leads are `l001` | corrected ids in `approvalsDb`, `agentRunsDb` | High |
| 9 | No path back to context: approvals had no conversation link; conversations had no lead | added `ApprovalRequest.conversationId` + `Conversation.leadId` (both optional — backend doesn't serve them yet) and links in `DraftCard`, `LiveThread`, `AuditTrailTable` | High |
| 10 | **Cockpit next-best-action was a dead end** — text only, no way to act. The vocabularies differ (`send_account_invite` → event `gate_invite`), so no naive mapping existed | new `NEXT_ACTION_EVENT` map + `NextActionButton`, which only renders when the event is legal from the current state and the user is elevated | High |
| 11 | Advancing the journey left the cockpit stale (old state + old recommendation, inches apart on screen) | `useAdvanceJourney` now invalidates `["cockpit", id]`, `["cockpit-nba", id]`, `["journey-overview"]` | High |
| 12 | Approve/edit/reject invalidated only `["approvals"]` → the thread and run log stayed stale | also invalidates `["conversations"]`, `["conversation"]`, `["agent-runs"]`, `["governance-audit"]` | Med |
| 13 | "Approve & deliver" lied on a pending L4/L5 draft — the first approval delivers nothing | label is now `Approve (1 of 2)` / `Second approve & deliver`; toast matches | Med |
| 14 | Reject took no reason and no confirmation — one click irreversibly rejected an L5 LOI with an empty audit reason | inline confirm + required reason, surfaced in the audit trail | Med |
| 15 | `ClientLinkCard` claimed "Linked" for any CLIENT/ENGAGED lead even with `lead.client == null` | distinguishes *linked* from *expected but not linked* | Med |
| 16 | `BreadCrumb` garbled id segments (`/console/<uuid>` → "550E8400 E29B …") despite its own comment claiming it skipped them | `isIdSegment()` → renders "Detail" | Med |
| 17 | Claim-card "Create" button was dead on empty required fields (silent `return`, no feedback) | `invalid` guard disables the button + inline message; applies to edit too | Med |
| 18 | No duplicate-key check on claim cards — keys govern approved wording | `claimCardKeyExists()` → 409 | Med |
| 19 | Claim-card edit page passed no `onDone`: no Cancel, and saving didn't navigate | `onDone` → router back to the list | Med |
| 20 | No `loading.tsx` on any new route; **no `error.tsx` anywhere in the app** | added `loading.tsx` ×8 and a `(dashboard)/error.tsx` boundary | Low/Med |

### Verified correct (no change needed)

- `pathTo()` slice indices in `journeyDb` are right for every target state (no off-by-one);
  `ARRIVED` early-returns, `DORMANT` has its own branch.
- `AdvanceControl`'s offered events match `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`, and the server re-checks.
  `ENGAGED` correctly reports "No further transitions".
- Held message bodies never leak: blanked in `postTeamMessage`, never rendered by
  `MessageRow`, excluded from the list preview.
- Reject correctly drops the card from the queue (`listApprovalQueue` filters status).
- Edit-then-approve keeps the edited text (`finalBody || draftBody`).
- The two-approver rule itself was logically sound — only unreachable (fix #7).
- Loading/empty/error states already existed *in-component* on every list surface.
- Server-side RBAC on the claim-card POST/PATCH and journey advance was already enforced.
- `SidebarLink` active state is correct for all sub-routes.

### False positives caught

- Recon proposed cross-linking the audit trail using `ApprovalRequest.leadId` "which is
  populated in the mock" — but those ids (`lead-1`) were **invalid** and would have 404'd.
  Fixed the data before adding the link (defect #8).
- Recon flagged `AgentRunResult`'s `"pending"` branch as dead code. It is defensive: the
  real backend returns `pending`. Left as-is.
- Recon flagged `getStateDistribution` as O(n²)-ish waste. True but not a bug; `n` is the
  mock lead count. Not changed.

### Deferred — needs a human decision

- **`/c/[token]` client-page preview.** `RevealLog` ticks "① Client page" green but there
  is no way to view what the visitor sees; Surface 1 owns that route and no token/URL is
  exposed to the dashboard. Product call: expose a preview URL, or leave the reveal as
  status-only.
- **Backend parity for the two new fields.** `conversationId` on `ApprovalRequest` and
  `leadId` on `Conversation` are typed optional and populated only in mock mode. The Django
  serializers don't expose them, so the links silently disappear in real mode. Needs a
  backend change (`ApprovalRequestSerializer`, `ConversationSummarySerializer`).
- **`journey/overview` in real mode** hardcodes `total: 0`, so the Overview distribution
  widget renders as `null` in production forever. Needs a real backend endpoint.
- **Cockpit richer read + agent-runs** exist on the backend only as I extended them; those
  backend changes remain uncommitted/undeployed.
- **Read-only users still get an editable claim-card form** that 403s on save. Whether to
  show a read-only detail view instead is a product/UX call.

### Runtime evidence

Driven over HTTP against `pnpm dev` (mock mode), then the server was stopped and scratch
files removed:

- run `proof` on `l001` → queue grows 3→4, new `apr-4-proof` carries `leadId l001` +
  `conversationId conv-1`.
- approve it → `conv-1` grows 2→3 messages, new message `agent | approved`; card leaves
  the queue.
- read-only user POST to `conv-1` → **403**; Admin → 201.
- edit a pending draft → status stays `pending` (no delivery).
- L5: Admin → `awaiting_second`; Admin again → **409**; Kang → `approved`.
- held L4 team message → appears in queue as `apr-5-concierge`.
- duplicate claim-card key → **409**.
- journey `qualify → reveal_client_page → gate_invite`: cockpit state and NBA follow
  exactly (`await_diagnosis → reveal_client_page → send_account_invite → await_claim`),
  reveals fire, and an illegal `engage` from `INVITED` → **409**.

Gate: `pnpm lint` ✅ · `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` ✅ (one real `prefer-const` caught and fixed).

## 2026-07-22 · Batch 4–5: Console rows, and a contract sweep of every screen

**Scope.** Triggered by a production screenshot of `/console` in which *every*
conversation row rendered a bare `—` where the last message should be. Batch 4 is that
row. Batch 5 sweeps every dashboard proxy path against the real backend URL map
(`engomondiii/itrix-backend` @ `07a7ad8`) — a screen is broken if its endpoint is
wrong, so this is the systematic form of "review all screens".

**Method note.** Recon was done by reading both sides of the contract directly rather
than by delegating, so there was no recon layer to false-positive. The one false
positive below was my own path-normalising, caught the same way — by reading the code.

### Real fixes

| # | Defect | Fix | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Console rows rendered `—` for three completely different states: no messages, messages held at the governance gate, and no data. On a governance console the middle case is the one an operator is looking for — a turn pending approval, possibly with a visitor waiting — and it was indistinguishable from an idle conversation | new `conversationPreview()` splits the states using `lastMessageAt`; the row now shows an **"Awaiting approval"** badge and says nothing was delivered | High |
| 2 | The row rendered `unreadCount` as "**N new**". On the team plane the backend resolves that field with neither `client` nor `user`, so no `last_read_at` filter applies and it is the count of *approved* messages, not unread ones — a mislabelled number, not a missing one | relabelled to "N approved"; the comment records why the honest label is not "new" | Medium |

Root cause of #1 is worth stating plainly: `lastPreview` comes from
`deliverable_messages()`, which admits only `AUTO_APPROVED`/`APPROVED` turns. That is
the **client-facing** filter, and the team console inherits it (the serializer's own
docstring says *"a row in the portal conversation list"*). An empty preview therefore
means "nothing approved", never "nothing happened".

### Verified correct (no change needed)

- **All eight lead actions** the detail page posts — `assign`, `status`, `note`,
  `meeting`, `escalate`, `nda`, `paid-eval`, `poc` — exist as `@action` methods on
  `LeadViewSet`. The action buttons on the lead screen are wired correctly.
- **Follow-up** `{id}/{complete|snooze|dismiss|reschedule}/` — all four exist; the
  dashboard only ever sends three of them.
- **Notifications** `{id}/read/` — exists (`@action(detail=True) def read`).
- **Settings → Profile** — `/auth/profile/` is mounted and correct.
- **Governance** claim-cards (list + detail) and audit, **agents** approval-queue /
  approval action / runs / `{key}/run`, **console** conversations + message,
  **conversations** `{id}`, **cockpit** leads + next-action, **journey** leads /
  advance / overview, **analytics** + analytics/pitch, **personas** list + detail —
  every one matches a real backend route.
- The **`—` no longer appears anywhere** in the console list; each state has words.

### False positives caught

- *"`/personas/{id}` is missing its trailing slash — Django `APPEND_SLASH` will break
  the POST."* Not real. The call is `` `/personas/${qs}` `` on the **list** route,
  where `qs` is a query string (`""` or `"?family=…"`), so it resolves to `/personas/`
  or `/personas/?family=…`. The artefact came from my own path-normalising sed
  collapsing `${…}` to `{id}`, not from the code. Reading the actual line settled it.
- Same cause: `/agents/approval/{id}/{id}/`, `/follow-up/{id}/{id}/` and
  `/nda/{id}/{id}/` all looked like doubled ids. They are `{id}/{action}` pairs and
  match the backend exactly.

### Deferred — needs a human decision

1. **`apps.settings` is never mounted.** `apps/settings/urls.py` defines exactly
   `sla/` and `notifications/` — precisely the two paths the dashboard calls — and the
   app is in `INSTALLED_APPS`, but `api/v1/urls.py` has no `path("settings/", …)`.
   **Settings → SLA** and **Settings → Notifications** therefore 404 in real mode.
   One-line backend fix. **Deliberately not patched dashboard-side:** the dashboard is
   calling the right path, and adding a `notImplementedOnBackend` guard would go stale
   the moment the route is wired. Written up in `../BACKEND_GAPS.md`.
2. **The console preview is computed with client-plane visibility.** An operator cannot
   see the latest turn of a conversation whose turns are all pending — the exact
   conversation that needs attention. Needs a team-plane preview
   (`all_messages().last()`), which is a backend serializer decision, not a frontend
   one. Batch 4 fix #1 makes the *state* visible; it cannot recover the text.
3. **No per-operator read state on the team plane.** `unreadCount` cannot mean "unread
   for you" until console participants carry a `user` and a `last_read_at`. Fix #2
   stops the UI claiming otherwise.

### Runtime evidence

`conversationPreview` exercised directly under `node --experimental-strip-types` across
five cases — approved turn, held-at-gate, genuinely empty, `null` timestamp off the
wire, and preview-without-timestamp — all pass, including the happy path. The stub
backend confirmed the proxy delivers all three shapes end to end
(`preview='…'` / `preview='' + lastMessageAt` / `preview='' + no timestamp`).
Throwaway script and scratch route both removed; `.env.local` restored to mock mode.

## 2026-07-22 · Batch 6: Lead-detail actions — stale cross-screen caches

**Scope.** The five action buttons on the lead detail rail (Book meeting, Mark NDA
required, Request paid evaluation, Mark PoC candidate, Escalate) and the two inline
controls (status, owner), traced through `useLeadActions` to what each one actually
mutates and which *other* screens read that state.

### Real fix

| # | Defect | Fix | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `useLeadActions` invalidated only `["lead"]` and `["leads"]`. But **four actions move `lead.status`** — which the **pipeline board** groups by and the **NDA list** filters on (`listNda` selects `NDA_LEAD_STATUSES`) — and two more create a deal record their own screen lists. With a 30s `staleTime`, marking a lead NDA-required and opening Pipeline showed it still in its old column | per-action invalidation: status-movers refresh `["pipeline"]`+`["nda"]`; eval/poc also refresh `["evaluations"]`/`["pocs"]`; assign refreshes `["pipeline"]` (cards show the owner). `escalate`/`addNote`/`bookMeeting` stay lead-local — they touch nothing off-screen | Medium |

### Verified correct (no change needed)

- **Not a permission hole.** None of the eight lead-action routes gate role
  dashboard-side, but every `@action` on `LeadViewSet` carries
  `[IsAuthenticated, IsDashboardUser, IsNotViewer]` — a read-only operator is refused
  one layer down, on the authoritative side. (This is the recon's classic false
  positive — "unguarded action" defended by the layer below — so it was checked
  before touching anything.)
- **`escalate` genuinely is lead-local** — it only appends a `LeadActivity`, changes
  no status and creates no record, so it correctly needs no extra invalidation.
  Reverting the instinct to invalidate it wholesale is the method working.
- Per-action keys chosen over blanket invalidation on purpose: a note or an
  escalation must not refetch the whole pipeline board.

### Runtime evidence (mock mode, driven over HTTP as Admin)

- `POST /api/leads/{id}/nda` on a `Meeting Booked` lead → `status: NDA`, and the lead
  went from **absent to present** on the NDA screen (`onNdaScreen: False → True`).
- `POST /api/leads/{id}/poc` on a `Closed` lead → pipeline column **`Closed → PoC`**
  AND a PoC record appeared on the PoCs screen. Both are cross-screen effects the old
  two-key invalidation left stale.

## 2026-07-22 · Batch 7: Pipeline board — the move menu

**Scope.** `usePipeline` / `useMoveLead` and the per-card "Move to stage" menu
(`PipelineCard.tsx:73`), which offers every value in `LEAD_STATUSES` — including NDA,
Evaluation, PoC and Licensed — as a one-click target.

### Real fix

| # | Defect | Fix | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `useMoveLead` invalidated only `["pipeline"]` and `["leads"]`. But the **NDA list** is derived from status (`listNda` selects `["NDA","Evaluation","PoC","Licensed"]`), and the menu can move a lead straight into NDA. Moving a card into the NDA column left the NDA screen showing the stale set for its 30s window | added `["nda"]` invalidation | Medium |

### Over-reach caught and reverted (the method working)

The first version of this fix also invalidated `["evaluations"]` and `["pocs"]`, on
the assumption — carried over from Batch 6 — that those screens are status-derived
too. **They are not.** `/api/pocs` returns `pocDb()` and `/api/evaluations` returns
`evalDb()`: Evaluation and PoC *records*, created only by the dedicated
"Request paid evaluation" / "Mark PoC candidate" actions, which `useLeadActions`
already refreshes.

Caught by the runtime rather than by reading: after moving a lead to `PoC`, its
pipeline column changed to `PoC` and `onPoCs` stayed **False**. Both keys removed —
shipping them would have been two needless refetches on every pipeline move, justified
by a comment that was simply wrong.

Batch 6 is unaffected and stands: `requestEvaluation` / `markPoC` *do* create records
(`createEvaluationForLead` / `createPoCForLead`), so refreshing those lists there is
correct.

### False positives caught

- *"`/api/nda` is broken — the dev log shows `TypeError: components.ComponentMod.handler
  is not a function`."* Not real. **Port 3001 was held by `wslrelay.exe`**, a WSL port
  forward, so half the verification traffic was hitting an unrelated service (its 401
  body was `{messageId: "auth.unauthorized", traceID: …}` — not this app's
  `{detail: …}` shape). Re-running the dashboard on port 3021: `/api/nda` → **200**.
  The error was HMR fallout from the port clash.
- *A typecheck failure in `.next/dev/types/validator.ts`.* Generated file, written by
  the dev server concurrently with `tsc`. Clean after stopping dev and removing
  `.next/dev/types`.

### Runtime evidence (mock mode, port 3021, driven as Admin)

`POST /api/leads/{id}/status {"status":"NDA"}` — the exact call the move menu makes —
on a `Meeting Booked` lead: pipeline column `Meeting Booked → NDA`, and NDA-screen
membership **False → True**. A subsequent move to `PoC`: column `NDA → PoC`, NDA
membership stayed True (correct — PoC is in `NDA_LEAD_STATUSES`), PoCs screen stayed
False (correct — no record was created).

## 2026-07-22 · Batch 8: NDA transitions, then a systematic sweep that closed the class

**Scope.** Started on `useNda`'s five mutations. Having now found the same
cache-staleness class in three consecutive batches (6, 7, 8), the batch pivoted
mid-way from hook-by-hook to an exhaustive sweep: *every* mock function that calls
`setStatus` — i.e. every code path that can move a lead on the pipeline board — cross
referenced against which hooks invalidate `["pipeline"]`.

### Real fixes

| # | Defect | Fix | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `useSignNda` — signing an NDA calls `setStatus(leadId, "Evaluation")` (`ndaDb.ts:181`), moving the card NDA → Evaluation. The hook refreshed `["leads"]`/`["lead"]` but not `["pipeline"]`. Its own comment said *"Signing advances the lead's pipeline status"* — the author knew, and missed the key | `["pipeline"]` added, **for signing only** — `prepare`/`send`/`decline`/`expire` write the NDA override and leave status alone | Medium |
| 2 | `useEvaluation().setStatus` — marking an evaluation **lost** moves the lead Evaluation → Closed (`dealsDb.ts:120`), a column change that also drops it out of `NDA_LEAD_STATUSES` | `["pipeline"]` + `["nda"]` | Medium |
| 3 | `usePoC().setStatus` — **completed** licenses the lead (PoC → Licensed) and **cancelled** closes it (PoC → Closed) (`dealsDb.ts:231,238`) | `["pipeline"]` + `["nda"]` | Medium |

### The sweep — this bug class is now exhaustively closed

`setStatus` has exactly **four** call sites in the mock layer, plus the lead's own
mutators. All are now covered:

| Call site | Reached from | Covered in |
|---|---|---|
| `leadsDb` `setStatus`/`markNda`/`markEvaluation`/`markPoC` | lead-detail actions | Batch 6 |
| `usePipeline` move menu | pipeline card | Batch 7 |
| `ndaDb.ts:181` (sign) | NDA screen | Batch 8 |
| `dealsDb.ts:120` (evaluation lost) | Evaluations screen | Batch 8 |
| `dealsDb.ts:231,238` (PoC completed/cancelled) | PoCs screen | Batch 8 |

Every other mutation hook — `useFollowUp`, `useReporting`, `useTemplates`,
`useSettings`, `useTeam`, `useApprovals`, `useClaimCards`, `useConsole`,
`useNotifications`, `useCockpit`, `useAttachments`, `useSupport`, `useEmail` — calls
`setStatus` nowhere, so none of them can move a lead and none needs the invalidation.
**Verified by grep over the whole mock layer, not by sampling.**

### Verified correct (no change needed)

- `decline` and `expire` genuinely do not move the lead — `mergeOverride` only. Proven
  in the runtime: expiring an NDA on a lead at `NDA` left its column at `NDA`. Not
  invalidating the board for them is correct, not an oversight.
- The `setPoCStatus` guard `lead.status !== "Licensed" && !== "Closed"` works: firing
  `completed` on an already-`Licensed` lead changed nothing. The first verification run
  looked like a failed proof and was actually the guard doing its job — the
  precondition had to be set up before the transition was observable.

### False positive caught

- *"The build is failing — `Error while requesting resource` ×3."* Not real.
  `next/font/google` fetches Space Grotesk, Inter and IBM Plex Mono at build time and
  the requests were flaky; the same build reported `✓ Compiled successfully`. Worth
  knowing as a **deployment fragility** (the build needs network for fonts) but it is
  not a code defect and was not "fixed".

### Runtime evidence (mock mode, port 3021 — 3001 is held by `wslrelay.exe`)

- Sign: lead at `NDA` → after `POST /api/nda/{id} {"action":"sign"}` column became
  **`Evaluation`**.
- Expire: lead at `NDA` → column stayed **`NDA`**.
- PoC completed: column `PoC` → **`Licensed`**, NDA membership stayed `True`
  (correct — Licensed is in `NDA_LEAD_STATUSES`).
- PoC cancelled: column `PoC` → **`Closed`**, NDA membership **`True` → `False`**.
